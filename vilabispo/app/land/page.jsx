  return (
    <section className="w-full flex-center flex-col">
      <span className="orange_gradient">Land in Vila do Bispo</span>
      <p className="desc tex-center">There are 7 areas that in total are more or less 170 Ha.</p>
      <br className="max-md:hidden"/>
      <p>We will auction the every Ha. when we accummulate a total of 2Mâ‚¬. 
        In the future i will continue to develop a smart contract to integrate with this project. 
        I'm not sure how it will be implemented. I'm open to sugesttions.</p>
        UI isn't for me so don't expect to much
    </section>

export default Land;
